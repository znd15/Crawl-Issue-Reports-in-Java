Bug,RESOLVED,Minor,Fixed,2.18.0,2.17.5: 2.18.2: 2.19.0,camel-swagger,Claus Ibsen,Bob Paulin,Assume I have rest path"
rest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute"");"
"
rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");"
And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB."
Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:"
/test:"
    get:"
      responses:"
        200:"
          schema:"
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'"
However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme"
 "
/testSub:"
    get:"
      responses:"
        200:"
          schema:"
             type : 'string'"
             format : 'com.ClassB'"
However I'd expect it to be:"
/testSub:"
    get:"
      responses:"
        200:"
          schema:"
